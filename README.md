# Idea Board
## What is Idea Board?
This is a simple application created with the MEAN stack to keep a log of ideas for upcoming hackathons.

The application is meant to be a very simple and very basic idea board, with no login; anyone can post anything.

## At The Present
### Only Using Angular
Right now Angular is the only thing implemented. This obviously means that nothing will be saved and nothing is really hosted at this time.

## For The Future
[ ] Node & Express
[ ] MongoDB
